# Health Resources Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS)
# Why HeRAMS is needed?
Health services play a crucial role in preventing avoidable deaths, illness and disability in emergencies. When health facilities and services are damaged, left without medicines, equipment, basic amenities or health workers, they cannot serve the population which may even have heightened healthcare needs due to the emergency.

Monitoring the availability of health services during an emergency is not easy. Uncertainties around access, security and time limitations frequently prevent systematic information gathering. Lack of information, in return, hampers effective decision-making, resource allocation, mobilization and advocacy for health in emergencies.


The HeRAMS approach (Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring)was developed to face these challenges. HeRAMS is an approach for monitoring health facilities, services and resources availability in emergencies.

# HeRAMS:
allows the assessment and monitoring of the status of health facilities and the availability of health services and resources in areas affected by emergencies
is a collaborative process involving all health sector actors
adaptable to any emergency or country context
designed to overcome access, security, time and resource constraints
cost and time efficient
supported by an online application (https://primewho.org/) that maximizes data entry and data management processes and provide real-time analysis of the situation
# How HeRAMS can be useful in emergencies

HeRAMS is an approach providing essential information to support decision making and coordination of health sector actors in emergencies.

# HeRAMS enables:
* timely identification of needs and gaps
* evidence-based decision making and coordination
* efficient planning and implementation
* detailed response monitoring
* advocacy and resource mobilization
HeRAMS can be applied in a range of emergencies, post-emergencies, recovery and development contexts.

# What can be monitored with the HeRAMS App?
The HeRAMS App provides a monitoring feature that allows tracking the evolution of the situation over time and helps re-adjust objectives and priorities as the situation evolves.


# What can be achieved with HeRAMS
HeRAMS monitors four major areas relevant to emergency response.
# 1. Health facilities
    * number
    * type
    * geographical location
    * functionality
    * accessibility
    
# 2. Resources for service delivery
    * human resources
    * electricity
    * water supply
    * cold chain
    * communications
    * waste management
# 3. Availability of health services in the following areas of work
    * general clinical services and trauma care
    * child health care
    * communicable diseases
    * STI and HIV/AIDS
    * maternal and new born health
    * sexual violence
    * non-communicable diseases
    * mental health
    * specific hospital care
# 4. Reasons for gaps in service availability
    * lack of health staff
    * lack of equipment
    * lack of medical supplies
    * lack of finances
    * lack of training
    * others
